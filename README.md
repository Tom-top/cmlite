# cmlite

cmlite is a Python toolkit that simplifies and extended some of the function of ClearMap

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The easiest way to get cmlite running is to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

To install all the pre-requiered libraries for cmlite there are two main options :

* Cloning the cmlite environment using a .yml file :

  For this, install TMT first by following the instructions under "Installing" and then run :

  ```
  conda env create --n envname -f path/to/the/environment.yml
  ```

### Installing

You can install cmlite by cloning it with Git :

```
cd folder/to/clone-into
git clone https://github.com/Tom-top/cmlite
```

If you don't have Git on your computer you can install it following this [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Once cmlite has been cloned, make sure to activate your virtual environment (if you use one), and launch your favorite IDE.

If you are on Windows make sure to download Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
